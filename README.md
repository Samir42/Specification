# Specification with EF Core

This is a simple Console application that uses Specifications for querying the database. 

I used SpectreConsole.NET to beautify the Console.

The app uses the in-memory database feature of the EF Core.

to run the application on the command line, just navigate to the SpecificationDemo folder and run `dotnet run`.
