# Specification with EF Core

This is a simple Console application that uses Specifications for querying the database. 

I used SpectreConsole.NET to beautify the Console.

The project aims to represent and bring the idea of how it would be hard to perform these filtrations without Specification. 

Of course, Specification can be overkill if not used properly / at the right time. 

But I guess the scenario is good enough to get the idea of the reason. 

The app uses the in-memory database feature of the EF Core.

to run the application on the command line, just navigate to the SpecificationDemo folder and run `dotnet run`.
